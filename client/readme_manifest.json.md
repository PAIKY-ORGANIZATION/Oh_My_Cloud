Hello people who found  this when sneaking in my code... These are just personal notes lol



1. The  "icon-x.png" images  MUST BE RESIZED. You need 2: One of 192x192  pixels and another of 512x512 pixels
2. I hear  some say that you can   point to the favicon.ico under ./src but that seems UNRELIABLE.

3. Things like "theme_color": "#1b1b1b" are optional and just for aesthetics.
